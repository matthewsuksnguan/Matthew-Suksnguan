<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a student at the University of California, San Diego currently majoring in Political Science with a concentration in International Relations. I am expected to earn my degree in 2026 and my interests are in national security, democratic backsliding, and international relations within the Indo-Pacific. Having taken classes in foreign policy analysis combined with courses in mathematics and statistics, it helps me to explore and analyze geopolitical trends from a data-based perspective. </p>

<h2>Academic Focus</h2>
<div class="cards">
<div class="card">
<h3>International Relations</h3>
<p>I like exploring how state and non-state actors make choices that have ramifications across the world. Specifically, within the Indo-Pacific wherein how the United States can counter a rising China.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>National Security</h3>
<p>I have an interest in exploring geopolitical trends, studying emerging technologies, and analyze risk associated with a nation's adversary and how a nation might defend itself from these threats. </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Democratic Backsliding</h3>
<p>One of the things which fascinate me is the fact of how democratic nations can fall victim to authoritarian movements. </p>
